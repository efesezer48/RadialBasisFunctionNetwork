Radial Basis Functions are a special class of feed-forward neural networks consisting of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and the output layer. This is fundamentally different from most neural network architectures, which are composed of many layers and bring about nonlinearity by recurrently applying non-linear activation functions.
RBF Neural networks are conceptually similar to K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) models, though the implementation of both models is starkly different. The fundamental idea of Radial Basis Functions is that an item's predicted target value is likely to be the same as other items with close values of predictor variables. An RBF Network places one or many RBF neurons in the space described by the predictor variables. The space has multiple dimensions corresponding to the number of predictor variables present.
